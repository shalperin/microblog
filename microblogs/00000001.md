Why is there no good social media for coders?  
I'm damn well not going to use Reddit.

I'm busy with other projects, but I've got
stuff I just need to get out, so we get this
clunky, BS microblog framework.

Aspiration - An SPA at the root of this project
that just endlessly scrolls the content.

Reach goal - someday make that searchable by whatever
means necessary.
