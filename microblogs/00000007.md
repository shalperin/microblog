# Empowering the client to create their own product.
## Aug 30, 2024

### When developing a project for a client, give them as much agency over their own content as possible.

When developing a project for a client, it’s essential to give them as much control over their content as possible. This principle relates to the distinction between content and container, which I’ll discuss separately. The core idea is that when you create a product for someone, the true value comes from the client’s ongoing interaction with it, long after its launch.

In practical terms, this means building the framework for the client, but not embedding yourself as the developer into their content management process. For example, if you’re developing a site for ultrasound medical imaging, you shouldn’t be responsible for managing the medical images, indexing, text, or linking. Instead, your role is to provide the tools and structure that empower the client to manage and evolve their own content independently.
