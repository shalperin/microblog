# Reading the Tom Swift books when I was 11
## Wed Aug 28, 2024

I didn't love the original post here, so I deleted it.  At some point I will talk about books, Drew's Bookshop in Cincinnati and the move towards large corporate bookshops, my mom the Antrhopologist, and other topics from my childhood.

The original post was a Swift programming post, which had a pun about the Tom Swift books.
