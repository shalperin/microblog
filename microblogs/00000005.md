# Core Philosophy: Reflections on Charity
## Aug 30, 2024

I believe it was Maimonides (Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, also known as the Rambam) who highlighted the virtue of giving anonymously to avoid, whether intentionally or unintentionally, creating hierarchies. 

### [Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matnot Aniyim 10:7-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Gifts_to_the_Poor.10.7?lang=bi)
_One who gives charity to the poor without knowing to whom he gave, and without the poor knowing from whom they received, this is performing a mitzvah solely for the sake of Heaven._
