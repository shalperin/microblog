# Core Philosophy: Reflections on Charity
## Aug 30, 2024

_One of the defining characteristics of "compulsory institutionalization" for a person of reasonable to high privilege—whether due to a legal transgression, a suicide attempt, a mental health crisis, or a drug overdose, particularly in the context of Philadelphia—is the abrupt stripping away of all life’s advantages. You find yourself suddenly thrust into a competitive, frightening, and often violent environment where the privileges and resources that once defined your life hold no value to the others confined alongside you. In this setting, you have nothing to “give”—nothing that might establish a paternalistic relationship or any hierarchy. You become completely dependent on the goodwill and non-violence of your community, with no capacity to lead or exert any influence among your peers. This experience, after the term of institutionalization is over, can profoundly reshape one’s views on charity._

I believe it was Maimonides (Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, also known as the Rambam) who highlighted the virtue of giving anonymously to avoid, whether intentionally or unintentionally, creating hierarchies. Yet, when I sit at my synagogue and look around the table at the octogenarians—people of immense privilege discussing philanthropy—I can’t help but sense that their worldview is deeply rooted in using charity as a means to position themselves as superior to, or paternalistic toward, those who serve their decidedly non-ascetic lifestyles. 

### [Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matnot Aniyim 10:7-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Gifts_to_the_Poor.10.7?lang=bi)
8.	Below this is one who gives charity to the poor without knowing to whom he gave, and without the poor knowing from whom they received. This is performing a mitzvah solely for the sake of Heaven.


Let me be clear about my participation in this community --

1.	**Nuremberg Laws**: Being identified as “Jewish” is not something easily shaken, whether or not it aligns with your personal choice.
2.	**Intellectual Engagement**: I genuinely love the intellectual discussions around Torah and Talmud; they offer rich, meaningful insights.
3.	**Humanism**: I believe that when humans come together, there is a unique energy or a gestalt — a power that some might call mystical. While I wouldn’t use the term “God” to describe this, others might. However, I do not subscribe to magical thinking, “sky gods,” or the supernatural.
4.	**Esoteric Experiences**: Building on the above, even though I don’t believe in magical thinking, I do recognize that certain experiences can be placed firmly in the realm of the “esoteric.” Personally, I prefer to explain these through concepts like Freud’s unconscious rather than through supernatural explanations.
5.	**Easing loneliness**: ...among individuals who generally don’t exhibit overtly problematic behaviors—this community isn’t prone to drug or alcohol abuse, nor is it likely to be violent. In essence, it’s about chanelling a real desperation for human contact, validation...etc, in a positive direction, among positive people. 

Alienation often breeds antagonism, and I feel that acutely here. As someone new to this community with few real relationships, I sometimes perceive, even if imagined, a sense of antagonism from the old guard. I frequently receive inappropriate questions about my tattoo (“hachol b’seder,” or “everything is OK,” done in the Florentine neighborhood of Tel Aviv by a Jewish tattoo artist). You might interpret the tone of this letter as critical or hostile, but really, it’s just me speaking, perhaps from a place that could be described, colloquially (perhaps inappropriately, absent diagnosis), as being “on the spectrum.” It might also reflect a sense of generational alienation—after all, the people in this community that I’m seeking out as peers are decidedly not peers. Maybe it’s a reaction to the constant drumbeat of "family, family, family", while I have none.

I believe that difficult experiences, such as _wrestling with the concept of God_, aren’t always supposed to be pleasant. In fact, much of the learning happens when they are not. Having my perspective and way of navigating the world reflected by, or at least in relationship with, the Jewish community around me is something that contributes to better mental health for me—assuming there’s a general perception of being loved, and being heard.  (A perception, as I have noted before, that is difficult for me to find in Zoom meetings, or really any gathering that does not involve coffee and bluebery muffins.)
