# Building prototypes
## Aug 30, 2024


### Prototypes help you approach development projects with much more humility and intentionality.
This is a simple idea - it basically just means, before you sign up to dump thousands of dollars into a project, use something off the shelf to prototype it.  I like SquareSpace or Wix in this role.  I don't love highly visual, but non-functional mockups.  Just use a site like SquareSpace to prototype out as much of the capabilities as you can.  If you need to weave in public Google Docs, or Forms...etc, then do it!    

Agile methodology is based on the premise that clients don't know what they want until they have something in front of them.  That _is_ true, but what Agile gets wrong is that the first stages of this process shouldn't be highly developer-time intensive. You just need to get something functional, and not visually horrible in front of the user, to get some feedback and direction for the project.
