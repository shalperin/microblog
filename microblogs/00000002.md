**prompt**

given a folder that contains markdown with the following naming conventions, can you write me some javascript to just render these one at a time with a next and a back button?

/microblogs/00000001.md
/microblogs/00000002.md
/microblogs/00000003.md
...etc


**response**
Certainly! Below is a simple JavaScript code example that loads and renders Markdown files one at a time with “Next” and “Back” buttons. This example assumes you are using a library like marked.js to convert the Markdown to HTML.

**said softly to nobody**

damn.
