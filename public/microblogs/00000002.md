# This website was generated by ChatGPT
## Tue Aug 28, 2024

My intent for this micro-blog was to have a place where I could mirror some of the comments
I'm making to social media, and also to be able
to write technical bits about code.

```
var hello = "hello world"
```

The easiest way to mix code with prose is to use a formatting language like [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) -- which simply defines basic rules for delineating code from paragraph, title, header, or list text.

I didn't entirely want to roll my own website, but it wasn't clear to me that there was a good social media platform preexisting that would allow me to do what I wanted.  Reddit was close, and has forums like [\r\iOSDevelopment](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSDevelopment/), but in my experience, the interactions on that site can be fairly coarse.

I had been working with ChatGPT 4o for about the past month in a lot of capacities, from answering questions about learning to program in [Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/aboutswift), to filling in some holes in my conversational/social life around topics like Jewish history, and philosophy.  The thought occured to me to have ChatGPT try to generate the platform I was looking for.

```
Please generate me the JavaScript and HTML for
a website with a micro-blog structure, and 
forward and back buttons, who's 
content is stored in markdown files, as in:
+ 00000001.md
+ 00000002.md
+ 00000003.md
+ ...etc.
```

Without much intervention from me, ChatGPT 4o was able to do this.  The resulting code is at [https://github.com/shalperin/microblog](https://github.com/shalperin/microblog).   _-edit: if you load that source code, you will want to look at the earliest commits. I have since modified the code that GPT originally spat out._

That was interesting, but it sent me into a bit of an existential spiral about the broader implications of machines being able to write their own code.  Hence the post from yesterday worrying about code generated from an LLM that was trained on sensitive, offensive cyberwar resources (click "previous" to read that below.)
