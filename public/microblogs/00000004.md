# Cleaning up yesterday's code and reflecting on my math education.

------

For a 27.0" screen, with a 1920 x 1080 (FHD) _effective_ resolution, the screen font will be 88% the sizeof a printed font.

My 46y/o developer eyes prefer my 27.0" screen, at 1344 x 756, the screen font is 126% the size of a printed font.

_Notes_

_(*)Effective resolution (ePPI): A "4k" (UHD) screen screen with a resolution of 3840x2160 at 200% scaling will have the same effective resolution as an FHD screen (1920x1080)_

_(**) For the same font size specified in points (pt)._

My experience working out the math for screen v.s. print typography (and objectively it's pretty basic -- the degree to which I struggled with it is more a function of my current mental health than any deficiency in aptitude) was one of starting in pencil, going to the sort of crappy, repetitive code I posted yesterday, to finally landing on today's  version.

I benefited from what few "standard" math classes that I took in post-bac and grad school, but I am not ashamed to admit that _I coded my way out of all of them_.  I only survived them because I was able to use a computer during the exams/final project and because I had worked as a developer for the previous 7 years.

A pedagogical question I have is whether kids can just skip the pen/pencil algebra and go right to using code to understand math?

```swift
import Foundation

let PT_SIZE = 1.0/72.0 // inches
let FHD_REZ = (w:1920, h:1080) // px
let UHD_REZ = (w:3840, h:2160)
let MY_REZ = (w:1344, h:756)

func findDiag(w:Double, h:Double)-> Double {  // unit is px
    //a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    //c = sqrt (a^2 + b^2)
    return sqrt((w*w) + (h*h))
}

struct Screen {
    var resW = FHD_REZ.w
    var resH = FHD_REZ.h
    var diagDim = 27.0
}

func scaleFactor(
    screen: Screen,
    printMsg: Bool = true
) -> Double {
    let pointsPerInchInPrint = 1.0 / PT_SIZE   // pt

    let pixelsPerInchOfScreen =
    findDiag(w:Double(screen.resW), h:Double(screen.resH)) / screen.diagDim // px
    let scaleFactor = pointsPerInchInPrint / pixelsPerInchOfScreen * 100 //pct

    if (printMsg) {
        print ("""
        A \(screen.diagDim)\" screen,
        with a \(Int(screen.resW)) x \(Int(screen.resH)) resolution*,
        the screen font will be \(Int(scaleFactor))% the size
        of a printed font.**
        """)
    }

    return scaleFactor
}

```
